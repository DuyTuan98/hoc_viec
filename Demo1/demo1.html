<h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
<p>Dear Eileen,<br>
<br>
Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part <br> 
of your <abbr title="">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
</p>
<h2>Starting dates</h2>
<p>
We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>
could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
<ul>
<li>First semester: <time>9 September 2016</time></li>
<li>Second semester: <time>15 January 2017</time></li> 
<li>Third semester: <time>2 May 2017</time></li> 
</ul>
Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
</p> 
You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.

<h2>Subjects of study</h2> 
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>
somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br> 
the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>
<ol>
<li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li> 
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br> 
    audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 × 10 <sup>4</sup>.)</li>
<li> <abbr title="">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li> 
</ol>
So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
 research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br>
</p>
<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2> 
<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br> 
my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>

<dl>
<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt> 
<dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around <br> 
in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd> 
<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt> 
<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br> 
involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br> 
tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br> 
modern styles such as Twerking.</dd> 
<dt>Arctic robot dance</dt> 
<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br> 
discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br> 
of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> 
because they were really cold.</dd> 
</dl>

Yours sincerely,<br>
